# Redoing the 42 basecamp C lists

From May 24th to June 19th, 2021, I participated in the basecamp of 42 SÃ£o Paulo, during basecamp I couldn't deliver all the lists, so I'm redoing the ones I had already delivered and doing the ones I hadn't delivered.
The codes are not being parsed by Moulinette program, so it may be that the output of the codes does not match the output that the Moulinette program expects.
